                </h2>

                <h4>TOPIC A:<br /> Cyberterrorism.</h4><br />
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>According to the F.B.I. cyberterrorism is: “any premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which results in violence against non-combat targets by subnacional groups or clandestine agents”.</p>
                <p>Due to the social context in which we live, in which, the telecommunications are a question of every day; in that every person who has a cellphone in the hand, means a user in a database, for a private company, or a government institution. A user in whom it is possible to exercise certain influence to determine his way of thinking, or decide on that products to acquire.</p>
                <h6>History</h6>
                <p>The cyberterrorism is a topic that has taken great relevance in the world through the one that we live. Twenty years ago there was not thought that the assaults to computers or servants would be possible, much less, that they had the consequences so serious that today have. </p>
                <p>One of the examples that we can give on the cybernetic threat, is the interference of some governments, superpowers in the main, in electoral preferencias of the persons, such it is the case of Russia in the presidential choice of The United States in November, 2016. In which, one accuses Russia of undermining the public faith in the democratic process of The United States, to denigrate Hillary Clinton and to harm his stability and presidency promotes.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (CASH), which it represents to 17 agencies of intelligence, and the Department of National Security (DNS) declared together that Russia hacked the National Democratic Committee and it leaked his documents to WikiLeaks. At the beginning of January, 2017, the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper attested before a committee of the Senate that the supposed interference of Russia in the presidential campaign of 2016 was beyond the hacking and included disinformation and diffusion of false news often promoted in the social networks. The Russian government denied repeatedly that had any participation in the cyber assaults to the National Democratic Committee.</p>
                <p>One of the topics mas recent, it was the violation to the platform "Facebook", in which, it was had in a direct way, I access to the accounts of 87 million persons, remaining exposed his personal information (direction, e-mail, photos, telephones, accounts, etc). This is worrying for the facility with the one that one can accede to the information of million persons, and have her. This is a violation to the human right of the privacy that cannot be tolerated and that must be treated as an immediate way in order that beech better controls and restrictions to the access to the public information of the persons.</p>
                <p>Another great problem are the influences that is possible to practise in the persons, step of having economic capitalist dyes, for political - electoral ends. Motivating even several governments to interfere in presidential choices in one of the most powerful countries of the planet. This without the great quantity tells of hacking to big companies of telecommunications that they contain the information of million persons. The above mentioned assaults or interferences, most of the times are motivated for the intention of selling to governments or big companies the information of the users.</p>
                <p>For these motives, and with the purpose of preserving the human rights of safety and security of the persons, the Security Council thinks that it performs supreme importance to submit to discussion this topic. The safety and privacy of the persons are not a tingh to to put a price on it, and less even, with the undemocratic ends that are claimed.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>TOPIC B:<br /> Biological and chemical attacks.</h4><br />
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Biological and chemical attacks are two global challenges being faced by various nations. Deliberate use of such damaging agents results in a huge loss of human lives as well as an adverse impact on the social and economic status of the country.Its goal is disruption of social and economic activity, the breakdown of government authority, and the impairment of military responses.</p>
                <h6>History</h6>
                <p>The use of chemical weapons is a several topic to discuss in United Nation since 1925, Security Council and with the help of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have the responsibility to control the complete and effective prohibition of the development, production, acquisition, storage, retention, transfer, destruction and use of chemical weapons, inclusive above of nuclear weapons. some examples of the last biological and chemical attacks are in August and September 2016 - Hospital officials and activists in Aleppo say chlorine gas is used in attacks and April 2017 - Warplanes strike the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun with a chemical agent, killing at least 83 people.</p>
                <h6>Current situation</h6>
                <p>The chemical warfare shows no sign of ending as Syria’s bloody civil war stretches into its seventh year.</p>
                <p>The armament conflict in Syria, since seven years ago, has as a consequence not only the death of million of syrians, likewise heinous crime, starvation, sexual violence, torture, indiscriminate assault against civilians and infrastructure, forced displacement and extinction, and of course, the use of chemicals weapons.</p>
                <p>The last attack on friday april 13 the United States, United Kingdom and France launched a cruise missile strike against Syrian regime installations On-site medics said a mixture of chlorine gas and sarin was used in the attack and killed approximately more than 40 people. </p>
                <p>In this case Security Council must prevent the continue attacks and the suffering of the people who is victim of this grievous assaults and make sure any other human been suffer this sort of tragedy.</p>
                <p>Prevention efforts also have a critical role to play, both in delegitimizing chemical and biological weapons and in impeding the acquisition of such capabilities in the first place.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>TOPIC C:<br /> The conflict in Myanmar.</h4><br>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>The crisis of the Rohingya in Myanmar is described for the United Nations like a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing".</p>
                <p>An army operation against alleged terrorists in Rakhine State since August 2017 has driven more than half a million Muslim Rohingyas to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>The Security Council considers of vital importance this topic, since in view of the time in which we live, that a minority is discriminated and chased by his own government, coming to the degree of not having the citizens' quality as his religious beliefs. Also, because as response to the pursuit, there was created a group of self-defense that only made the conflict bigger. </p>
                <h6>History</h6>
                <p>Historically the population of Arakan, specifically the ethnic group of the Rohingya, have been victims and suffered from discrimination and violations to human rights because of the military dictatorship that lives Burma. </p>
                <p>This group of persons has been victim of pursuit and massive displacements for racial and religious reasons in the years of 1977-1978, 1991-1992 and 2012. The consequence to the above mentioned pursuit has generated a phenomenon of displacement to other countries, principally Bangladesh. </p>
                <p>As response to the pursuit, genocides and violations to human rights, the Rohingya created a group of self-defense to repel the assaults in his against, giving like proved a major escalation in the conflict.</p>
                <h6>Current situation</h6>
                <p>The epicenter of humanitarian disaster and mass displacement, caused by the recurrent cycle of clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya, who have lived in this state for decades. </p>
                <p>Nearly 700,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled across the border of Myanmar, another 400,000 live in a "difficult situation" within the country, without access to health or education services.</p>
