                <!-- <p>ECOSOC is one of the six main organs of the United Nations established by the UN Charter in 1946, is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as for implementation of the internationally agreed development goals. It is the central platform for fostering debate and innovative thinking, forging consensus on ways forward, and coordinating efforts to achieve internationally agreed goals. It is also responsible for the follow-up to major UN conferences and summits.</p>
                <p>Reforms over the last decade, particularly General Assembly resolution 68/1, have strengthened ECOSOC’s leading role in identifying emerging challenges, promoting innovation, and achieving a balanced integration of the three pillars of sustainable development—economic, social and environmental.</p>
                <p>The UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September of 2015 which proposes 17 Objectives with 169 integrated and indivisible goals that cover the economic, social and environmental spheres. The fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is currently the main objective of the Economic and Social Council and that is why it constantly creates plans of action in favor of people, the planet and prosperity, which also intends to strengthen the universal peace and access to justice.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">
                  <span class="section-heading-lower">Commitee Topics</span>
                </h2>

                <h4>TOPIC A:<br /> Economic impact of prostitution and trafficking in women.</h4>
                <p>In 1949, the UN General Assembly adopted the "Convention for the Suppression of Trafficking in Persons and Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others", which has only been ratified so far by only 51 countries, which, in the opinion of some non-governmental organizations (NGOs), constitutes a "further example of social hypocrisy in the face of the problem".</p>
                <p>As factors of its proliferation is the existence of societies that consider women as a simple sexual object, the economic situation, the image of women in certain traditional societies and the promotion of tourism in developed countries.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, as consequences of prostitution we have exploitation and sexual slavery, prostitution, forced marriages and organ trade among the atrocities that victims face.</p>
                <p>For the Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, trafficking prospers where the law is weak or non-existent, however, there are countries that have legislated to legalize prostitution. A striking example is the Netherlands, where a complete regulation of prostitution was created as a licit, allowed and regulated business activity by the Executive Power, so that all the benefits within the health and social security system are guaranteed to the hetairas according to their job.</p>
                <p>The collection of taxes by the State of an activity that was previously illegal contributes to the improvement of public services offered, including the improvement of the health service; in addition to ensuring a decent job for sex workers. Germany legalized prostitution in 2002, which encouraged the creation of an industry thought to have a value of US $ 22,000 million a year and is estimated to increase, since in its neighboring country France, it is penalized to pay for sexual services, which will promote sex tourism.</p>
                <p>It is for the foregoing that the solutions offered individually by the countries do not serve much, there must be an international agreement that guarantees the rights of sex workers and eradicates trafficking in persons, sexual exploitation and sexual tourism.</p><br />

                <h4>TOPIC B:<br /> Transnational companies as agents that harm countries.</h4>
                <p>Multinational companies or transnational companies are those that are not only established in their country of origin, but also are established in other countries to carry out their commercial activities both sale and purchase as well as production in the countries where they have been established.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there is an undeniable asymmetry between transnational corporations, States and Peoples. On the one hand: with the complicity of the States concerned "attracting investment", the transnational companies are protected with a solid shell-which includes free trade agreements and investment protection, with their corresponding sanctioning mechanisms. The latter are placed in a logic in which arbitration strives to replace force with justice. Institutions such as the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) are clear examples of such privatization of justice, as well as other ISDS mechanisms. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, violations of human rights and the rights of peoples and nature are inherent in the operations of transnational corporations, as well as systematic. However, there is no binding instrument at the international level that requires them to respect human rights.</p>
                <p>Opponents say it is easier for foreign investors to attack government policies using ISDS than it would be to do so through even the best established and most reliable national systems. First, they claim that ISDS gives them an additional option to oppose government policies. One example often cited came after Australia passed a law in 2011 requiring that cigarettes could only be sold in packages without logos. Philip Morris and a group of other tobacco multinationals disputed the legislation in the Australian courts without success. For local law, that was the end of the story. However, Philip Morris was able to launch another action - which is still standing - thanks to the ISDS agreement.</p>
                <p>Besides that these practices undermine the democracy and institutions of the countries, they have a negative impact on the environment and the sustainable development of people, especially in developing countries. A clear example was that of the Chevron oil company. Between 1972 and 1993 (then known as Texaco) it poured 18 billion gallons of toxic water into the tropical forests of Ecuador without any kind of repair, destroying the livelihoods of local farmers and making the indigenous populations impunity.</p>
                <p>For ECOSOC, it is important to put the issue on the table and create an international treaty that impedes the practices carried out by the big companies for their own benefit, but which enormously harms the development of nations, thus eradicating the impunity with which these companies enjoy, becoming an obstacle to the fulfillment of the 17 sustainable development objectives, created by the UN.</p><br />

                <h4>TOPIC C:<br /> Regulation and creation of public policies to avoid the waste of food of the companies.</h4>
                <p>According to the FAO, about 1300 million tons of food produced are wasted. Enough food to feed 2 billion people. In Latin America and the Caribbean each year the region wastes around 15% of its available food, despite the fact that 47 million of its inhabitants still live with hunger. it refers to the losses derived from the decision to discard foods that still have value, and is mainly associated with the behavior of wholesalers and retailers, food sales services and consumers.</p>
                <p>Among the causes that cause food waste are:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Supermarkets impose high aesthetic standards for fresh produce so they reject some foods because of their weight, size and appearance of crops.</li>
                    <li>In many cases, it is due to unclear, rigid and misunderstood labeling rules.</li>
                    <li>Foods that were not sold in large supermarkets are thrown away or destroyed.</li>
                    <li>The industry educates the consumer wrongly about the consumption of food and encourages them to consume products that are almost "perfect", rejecting those who do not look like this.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>The consequences of food waste are serious, impact the sustainability of food systems, reduce local and global availability of food, generate lower incomes for producers, increase prices for consumers. Furthermore, they have a negative effect on the environment due to unsustainable use of natural resources: a) 3 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere per year; b) 250km3 of water are lost or wasted per year to produce food and C) 1.4 billion hectares - 28% of the world's agricultural land - are used annually to produce food that is lost or wasted.</p>
                <p>Countries like France have already legislated in this regard. On May 14, 2015, an amendment was approved, within a broader law on energy and the environment, which prohibits large supermarkets from destroying unsold products at the risk of facing fines or even jail sentences. In addition, supermarkets of more than 400 m2 are obliged to sign contracts to donate unsold but still edible products to charitable organizations or for use as animal feed or agricultural compost.</p>
                <p>However, there are still many countries that do not legislate on the matter despite the constant and massive waste of food.</p>
                <p>FAO is a specialized agency that is part of the ECOSOC System and together with it, the focus of the work that is carried out is to prevent and reduce the loss and waste of food, driven by the broader conception of some systems sustainable food and food security and nutrition for all. Due to the absence of public policies that avoid this problem, ECOSOC supports adequate global, regional, national and local policies and technical interventions, and promotes the achievement of results through incentives and regulatory frameworks. The Council collaborates with the public sector, the private sector and civil society through the Global Initiative on the Reduction of Food Loss and Waste.</p>
                <p>The regulation contributes to achieving Objectives 1, 2 and 12 of the Sustainable Development Agenda of 2030, consisting of eradicating poverty, hunger and promoting responsible production and consumption of food.</p><br />
